# Avl_Tree
The tenth laboratory work in the first year of the Faculty of Mathematics of YarSU on the basics of programming in C++

It is required to implement a binary search tree and display a menu that demonstrates
the capabilities of the program for working with a tree:
1. Building a search tree based on data entered from the keyboard (adding
nodes to the tree in the specified order),
2. Building a search tree based on data from a file,
3. Printing a tree,
4. Adding another node to the tree,
5. Deleting a node,
6. Selecting (searching) a node,
7. Changing information about the selected object,
8. Requests for options,
9. Exit.
To get a grade of "5" for laboratory work, it is necessary to simultaneously:
1. Complete the work on time
2. Implement a balanced tree

For example task for class MARSH:
Describe a class named MARSH containing the following fields: the name of the starting point
of the route; the name of the destination of the route; route number, travel time. Write
a program that performs the following actions:
● Building a tree, entering data (file, keyboard of the user's choice); entries in
the tree should be ordered by route numbers.
● Displaying information about trains departing after time K from point N.
● Displaying information about trains that arrive at point N.
If there are no such routes, display the corresponding message.
Provide for the possibility of editing tree elements – deleting, adding,
changing.
